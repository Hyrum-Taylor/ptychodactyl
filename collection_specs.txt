#### Probe positioning parameters
width = 1.0                     # Horizontal scanning range (mm)
height = 1.0                    # Vertical scanning range (mm)
step_size = 0.1                 # Spacing between probe positions (mm)
pattern = spiral                # Geometric pattern for ptychography scan (rect, hex, or spiral)
num_rotations = 0               # Number of rotational steps (zero for no rotation)

#### Image acquisition parameters
background_frames = true        # Set to true to record a background image with the laser off
frames_per_take = 10            # Number of frames to sum for each measurement (including background)
resolution = 512                # Desired final image size (number of pixels on a side)
exposure = 0.25                 # Exposure time (ms)
gain = 1                        # Analog gain

#### Other parameters
distance = 0.075                # Distance from lens (or sample) to detector (m)
energy = 1.957346               # Laser photon energy (eV)
