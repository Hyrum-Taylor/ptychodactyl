#### Pre-processing parameters

flip_positions = n                  # 'h' to flip horizontal, 'v' for vertical, 'hv' for both, 'n' for neither
rotate_positions = 11.5             # Angle in degrees between the stages and the camera coordinates
background_subtract = true          # Set to true to perform background subtraction
vbleed_correct = 0.35               # Vertical bleeding reduction factor (must be between 0 and 1)

#### Reconstruction parameters
# Separate multiple algorithms with a semicolon. Reconstructions will be performed from left to right. Update strengths
# should be given as a decimal from 0 to 1.
algorithm           = rpie  , epie              # Options: rpie, epie
num_iterations      = 5    , 10                 # number of iterations to run
obj_up_initial      = 0.9   , 1.0               # Initial object update strength

pro_up_initial      = 0.75  , 0.5               # Initial probe update strength
pro_up_final        = 0.5   , 0.25              # Final probe update strength

#### Post-processing parameters
animate = false                     # Set to true to animate the reconstruction progress at each iteration.
